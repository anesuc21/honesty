The process of respiration in which cells produce energy from glucose is known as cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is the process by which cells produce energy from glucose, a type of sugar, through a series of biochemical reactions. These reactions involve the breakdown of glucose molecules and the release of energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the primary energy currency of the cell. There are three main stages of cellular respiration: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis is the first stage of cellular respiration and takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell. In this stage, glucose is converted into pyruvate, producing a small amount of ATP and NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). The citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle or tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, takes place in the mitochondria and involves the breakdown of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, which is then converted into ATP, NADH, and FADH2 (flavin adenine dinucleotide). Oxidative phosphorylation is the final stage of cellular respiration and takes place in the mitochondria. In this stage, the electrons from NADH and FADH2 are passed through a series of electron transport chains, which generate a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This gradient is then used to drive the production of ATP through the process of chemiosmosis. Overall, cellular respiration is a complex process that involves the breakdown of glucose and other organic molecules to produce energy in the form of ATP.", "exact_match": 0, "has_match": 1, "pred": "correct", "has_gold_answer": true}
