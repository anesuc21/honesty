For example, in a grassland ecosystem, plants produce energy through photosynthesis, which is then transferred to herbivores through consumption. The herbivores then transfer the energy to carnivores through consumption, and the carnivores transfer the energy to decomposers through decomposition.\n\nTrophic transfer is an important concept in ecology and is used to understand the flow of energy through an ecosystem.
