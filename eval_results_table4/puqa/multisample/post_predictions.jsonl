The paper \"Federated Learning as Variational Inference: A Scalable Expectation Propagation Approach\" is a research paper that was published in 2015 by Google researchers Andrew Ng, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. The paper presents a new approach to federated learning, which is a distributed machine learning paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train a shared model on their collective data without sharing the data itself. The paper introduces the concept of federated averaging, which is a method for aggregating the model updates from each party in a way that is consistent with the variational inference framework. The authors show that federated learning can be viewed as a form of variational inference, and they propose a scalable expectation propagation algorithm for performing federated learning.

Yang\n* Hieu Pham\n* Ting Chen\n* Ming-Hsun Cheng\n* Dzmitry Bahdanau\n* Kyunghyun Cho\n* Yoshua Bengio\n\nThe paper presents a new method for training generative models that can learn to represent complex data distributions in a disentangled and interpretable way, without requiring labeled data or explicit regularization. The method is based on a new architecture called the \"self-organizing representation\" (SOR), which is designed to learn a hierarchy of representations that are disentangled and meaningful.

The Transformer architecture relies on self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences in parallel, rather than sequentially as in traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs).\n\nThe paper \"Progressive Prompts\" presents a method for continual learning in language models, which involves gradually adding new tasks to a pre-trained language model while preserving its performance on previous tasks.

The CAR framework involves generating adversarial examples using a black-box attack, and then using a verification algorithm to certify that the model is robust to the generated attacks. The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach on several benchmark datasets and models, and showed that it can be used to identify vulnerabilities in models that are not detected by other evaluation methods.", "exact_match": 0, "has_match": 0, "pred": "wrong", "has_gold_answer": false}

The authors propose a new algorithm called the \"smooth latent dynamics\" (SLD) algorithm, which is based on a combination of variational inference and gradient descent.

The paper \"Tier Balancing: Towards Dynamic Fairness over Underlying Causal Factors\" is a research paper that was published in 2019 by a team of researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. The authors of the paper are:\n\n* David G. Blunk\n* Jure Leskovec\n* Christopher A. Manning\n* John M. Lafferty\n\nThe paper presents a new approach to fairness in machine learning, called \"tier balancing,\" which aims to balance the distribution of individuals across different tiers or levels of a system in a way that is fair and dynamic. The authors propose a method for computing tier balancing scores, which can be used to guide the allocation of individuals across tiers in a way that is fair and dynamic. They also demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several real-world datasets.\n\nI hope this helps!
