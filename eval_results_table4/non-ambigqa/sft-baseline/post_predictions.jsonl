One of the key components of RVV is the inhibitor of factor Xa (FXa), which is a serine protease that plays a critical role in the coagulation cascade. When RVV is administered to a patient, it can cause a rapid and significant increase in the activity of FXa, leading to a state of anticoagulation. This can result in bleeding and other hemorrhagic complications.\n\nIn contrast, the dilute Russell's viper venom test (DRVVT) is a diagnostic test that is used to assess the coagulation status of a patient. In this test, a patient's blood is mixed with a dilute solution of RVV, and the resulting coagulation profile is measured. If the patient's blood is able to clot in the presence of the dilute RVV solution, it suggests that the patient's coagulation system is functioning normally. However, if the patient's blood is unable to clot, it may indicate that the patient has a coagulation disorder or that the venom has caused a state of anticoagulation.\n\nIn summary, the coagulation factor that is activated by Russell's viper venom is factor Xa (FXa). The dilute Russell's viper venom test (DRVVT) is a diagnostic test that is used to assess the coagulation status of a patient by measuring the ability of the patient's blood to clot in the presence of a dilute solution of RVV.", "exact_match": 0, "has_match": 0, "pred": "wrong", "has_gold_answer": true}

Active surveillance: This involves actively collecting safety data through various means, such as clinical trials, observational studies, and registry-based research.\n3. Electronic health records (EHRs): EHRs can be used to identify and monitor AEs in real-time, as well as to evaluate the safety of a drug in a large and diverse population.\n4. Claims data analysis: This method uses administrative claims data to identify and analyze safety issues related to a drug, such as adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and drug interactions.\n5. Clinical trials: Conducting clinical trials after a drug has been approved can provide valuable safety data and help to identify potential safety issues that may not have been detected during the pre-marketing phase.\n6. Pharmacovigilance systems: These systems are designed to monitor the safety of drugs in real-time and can provide early detection of safety issues.\n7. Risk management plans: These plans are developed and implemented to identify, assess, and minimize risks associated with a drug.\n8.

The information you have provided is not accurate. All courts did not become courts of equity in 1873. In fact, the concept of courts of equity has a much longer history and can be traced back to medieval England.\n\nCourts of equity, also known as chancery courts, were established in the 12th century to deal with cases that did not fit neatly into the common law system. These courts had the power to issue injunctions and other equitable remedies to address situations that were not covered by the common law.\n\nOver time, the power of the courts of equity grew, and they became an important part of the English legal system. In the 19th century, many of the common law courts were merged with the courts of equity, and the term \"court of law\" became synonymous with the term \"court of equity.\"\n\nSo, while the consolidation of courts in 1873 may have had an impact on the legal system, it did not mark the point at which all courts became courts of equity.", "exact_match": 0, "has_match": 0, "pred": "idk", "has_gold_answer": true}

He was born in 1858 and died in 1947. Planck is best known for his work on the theory of black-body radiation, which led to the development of quantum mechanics. In 1900, Planck introduced the idea that energy is quantized, meaning that it comes in small, discrete packets, or quanta. This idea challenged the traditional view of energy as a continuous, wave-like phenomenon and laid the foundation for the field of quantum mechanics.\n\nPlanck's work on black-body radiation also led to the development of the Planck constant, which is a fundamental constant in physics that relates the energy of a photon to its frequency. The Planck constant has played a central role in the development of quantum mechanics and has been used to explain a wide range of phenomena, from the behavior of atoms and molecules to the properties of solids and liquids.\n\nIn addition to his work on quantum theory, Planck was also a pioneer in the field of theoretical physics. He was one of the first scientists to recognize the importance of mathematical modeling in the study of physical phenomena and was known for his use of mathematical techniques to solve problems in physics.\n\nOverall, Max Planck was a groundbreaking physicist who made significant contributions to our understanding of the behavior of energy and the nature of reality itself.

The exact origin of the phrase is unclear, but it is believed to have originated in the 17th or 18th century in England. One theory is that it may have come from a medieval belief that the devil would carry people off to hell in a handcart, which was a small, two-wheeled cart used for carrying goods. Another theory is that the phrase may have originated from a phrase in the Bible, specifically in the book of Revelation, where it is written \"And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains.\" (Revelation 6:15)\n\nIn this context, the phrase \"to hell in a handcart\" could be used to describe a situation where people are being carried off to hell, or a place of great suffering, suddenly and unexpectedly.\n\nIt is important to note that the phrase \"to hell in a handcart\" is often used in a humorous or ironic way to describe a situation that is not necessarily serious or dire.

Many indigenous peoples had a deep connection to their traditional lands and were actively resisting colonization, but their voices were ignored or suppressed by the British.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the historical injustices perpetrated against indigenous peoples and a movement towards reconciliation and redress. This has involved acknowledging the rights of indigenous peoples to their traditional lands and territories, and working towards a more equitable and just relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples.", "exact_match": 0, "has_match": 0, "pred": "wrong", "has_gold_answer": true}
